title: "Speaking at NDC Security (Oslo)"
date: 2022-04-06

I head the pleasure of giving 2 sessions at NDC Security in Oslo today. After 2,5 years of not being at a conference in real person, this was the first time speaking in front of an audience and sitting in on sessions in real life! Super weird to do in this time of turmoil in the world, but when you sign up to speak, the conference organizers are relying on you to show up of course!

For me a nice way to get back to public speaking in front of a group: I've done my session on "How to use GitHub Actions with security in mind" a lot last year, but everything was online due to corona! The atmosphere at a conference and in front of a real live audience is completely different from doing this from your home office. Sitting in to hour long sessions is really hard work if you do this from home, and as speaker you often do get little to no feedback during the sessions from home. Honestly, the less professionally a virtual session has been arranged, the more engagement and fun I had in them! A simple meetup for example just uses a Zoom/Teams session where people can chat and ask questions. That was often missing in "professionally managed" sessions.
