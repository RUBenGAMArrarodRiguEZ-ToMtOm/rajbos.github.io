I keep coming across files in GitHub that have some mystic magic feeling to them. There's always a small incantation to come with them: the have to have the right name, the right extension *and* have to be stored in the right directory. I wanted to have an overview of all these spells for myself, so here we are ðŸ˜‰.

# Overview
A list of all the magic files that I came across in GitHub.

Some of these are extra tricky, like for example the organization profile lives in a different directory and repo then the user profile readme: `.github` repo in the org and then in a folder named `profile`: README.md.
